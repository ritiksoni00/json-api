# Techdome task!

i have created three users 
| Username  | Password | Role
| ----- | -------- | -----|
| ritik  | toor | superuser |
| admin | Abcd1234@  | admin |
| user1 | Abcd1234@  | normal |

for *crud* tasks we can use admin or superuser!

clone this repo to your Local machine and install required libs into your virtual env by `pip install -r requirements.txt` {misspelled file name}! {hope you activated yu `venv`}

after that run `python manage.py runserver` 

i didnt set the templates for root url 

im using postman to working with my api 

for get all todo list we need to hit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/alltodos/` with `get` https method and we will get the result like

:- for create a new todo `http://127.0.0.1:8000/create/` with `post` you can check the perm in the picture that normal user cant create, update or delete any todo items.
